# Rochelle's 100 Days Of Code - Log/Journal

I'm back with a better attitude and more will. I added a goals section that I saw on someone else's fork(?) and thought it would be cool to
set my intentions for the next 100 days. I will be as realistic as possible and may add more goals I am comfortable( or uncomfortable) with.
