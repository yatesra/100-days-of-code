# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 7th, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Finished the last 52% of the Applied Accessabilty portion of FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design track

**Thoughts:** I have not practiced coding in a while and so it was tough starting off in the middle of the section like that.


### Day 2: June 8, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: I got to 50% on FreeCodeCamp's CSS Grid portion of the Responsive Web Design Track. 

**Thoughts**: Things are starting to look more familiar to when a did html more regularly. I love this feeling.

### Day 3: June 9th, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
I finished the CSS Grid portion of the responsive Web Design track on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**:
I felt detached from this session. I think I was excited about almost being done with the track. Just 5 projects to go!


### Day 4: June 10th, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
I started my FreeCodeCamp tribute page project on Zelda Barbour Wynn Valdes.

**Thoughts**:
Html is what I am most comfortable and familiar with so after a few days getting reacquainted, this felt ok. I realized time flew when I started this project. The user stories involving divs tripped me up so I will need to practice that.

### Day 5: June 11th, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
I was given a rec to try Ania Kubow's Responsive Online Portfolio Tutorial and I played around with it.


**Thoughts**:
I needed something from scratch so I'm glad a Twitter follower recommended it to me. I was having problems linking files and a domain and this really helped.

### Day 6: June 12th, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
I worked on my Tribute page project. I added unordered lists and more CSS. 

**Thoughts**:
It's coming along. I was confused about the id tags last time I used them and I feel way better about them today.

### Day 7: June 14th, 2021
**Today's Progress**:
I got my formatting wrong and pressed strange buttons in codepen.OMG I could not find the problem for 30 minutes!

**Thoughts**:
I am good at HTML but today it stumped me, I am very close to finishing but I should really be done with this simple little page.

**Day 8: June 15th, 2021**:
I worked on my Scratch project for CS50x. It requires a lot of planning and design effort.

**Thoughts**:
I don't really like Scratch, the colors make it seem less intimidating but it definately has a big learning curve.

**Day 9: June 16th, 2021**:
I worked on my Tribute page project for FreeCodeCamp. I passed the user stories in the test suite 10/10.


**Thoughts**:
HTML is easy and this project is simple. I dragged my feet.

**Day 10: June 17th, 2021**:
I added CSS styling to my finished tribute page before submitting my project.

**Thoughts**:
CSS is not really so fun to me but today it did not feel so tedious. I actually came out with something I was happy with.
