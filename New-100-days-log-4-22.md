# Rochelle's 100 Days Of Code - Log/Journal

I'm back with a better attitude and more will. I added a goals section that I saw on someone else's fork(?) and thought it would be cool to
set my intentions for the next 100 days. I will be as realistic as possible and may add more goals I am comfortable( or uncomfortable) with.

### Day 1: Tuesday, April 26, 2022 


**Today's Progress**: Worked on a practice JS project, creating a gam of "Whac-a-Mole" by following a tutorial.

**Thoughts:** It was starting a project that was heavely focused on JS; it's what I am least comfortable with out of the 3 languages I know. My code kept messing up and though I was able to get the errors to disappear. The game didn't work! I will have to see what I did wrong. Many programmers say you must do instead of just watching when it comes to programming, even if you don't understand, but it all just felt like I was copying info down( I didn't copy + paste) and dropping it in VSCode. I hope the "learning" happens soon.

I also had a problem with Github; I tried to push my folders through VSCode extension to a repo I already made and it would not let me even though it said I could. It kept seeing it as me trying to make a new repo with a name I already had for the repo I made before creating those folders \*sigh\* idk.. I'll try manually adding it next time but I'll definately need to figure out why the way I did it didn't work.

### Day 2: April 27, 2022 


**Today's Progress**: Tried to fix the error in my JS tutorial project (Whac-a-Mole) I had lots of syntax errors like extra operators, misspelled words, and incorrectly named class or elements (?). While I got it to function way better and catch on to a few patterns, it's still v broken.

**Thoughts**: I felt like I had maybe 2 connections when I had problems with my code. I'm almost glad it didn't work the first time because then I had to hunt for what was wrong and that forced me to get familiar with the code, especially js.

### Day 3: April 27, 2022 


**Today's Progress**: Switched it up and practiced a different project from the Ania Kubrow JS games series. This one was rock paper scissors and it went better than WAM but still buggy.

**Thoughts**: Was able to recognize more errors quicker today.
