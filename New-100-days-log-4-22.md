# Rochelle's 100 Days Of Code - Log/Journal

I'm back with a better attitude and more will. I added a goals section that I saw on someone else's fork(?) and thought it would be cool to
set my intentions for the next 100 days. I will be as realistic as possible and may add more goals I am comfortable( or uncomfortable) with.

### Day 1: Tuesday, April 26, 2022 


**Today's Progress**: Worked on a practice JS project, creating a gam of "Whac-a-Mole" by following a tutorial.

**Thoughts:** It was starting a project that was heavely focused on JS; it's what I am least comfortable with out of the 3 languages I know. My code kept messing up and though I was able to get the errors to disappear. The game didn't work! I will have to see what I did wrong. Many programmers say you must do instead of just watching when it comes to programming, even if you don't understand, but it all just felt like I was copying info down( I didn't copy + paste) and dropping it in VSCode. I hope the "learning" happens soon.

I also had a problem with Github; I tried to push my folders through VSCode extension to a repo I already made and it would not let me even though it said I could. It kept seeing it as me trying to make a new repo with a name I already had for the repo I made before creating those folders \*sigh\* idk.. I'll try manually adding it next time but I'll definately need to figure out why the way I did it didn't work.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, 
but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
