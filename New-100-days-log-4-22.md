# Rochelle's 100 Days Of Code - Log/Journal

I'm back with a better attitude and more will. I added a goals section that I saw on someone else's fork(?) and thought it would be cool to
set my intentions for the next 100 days. I will be as realistic as possible and may add more goals I am comfortable( or uncomfortable) with.

### Day 1: Tuesday, April 26, 2022 


**Today's Progress**: Worked on a practice JS project, creating a gam of "Whac-a-Mole" by following a tutorial.

**Thoughts:** It was starting a project that was heavely focused on JS; it's what I am least comfortable with out of the 3 languages I know. My code kept messing up and though I was able to get the errors to disappear. The game didn't work! I will have to see what I did wrong. Many programmers say you must do instead of just watching when it comes to programming, even if you don't understand, but it all just felt like I was copying info down( I didn't copy + paste) and dropping it in VSCode. I hope the "learning" happens soon.

I also had a problem with Github; I tried to push my folders through VSCode extension to a repo I already made and it would not let me even though it said I could. It kept seeing it as me trying to make a new repo with a name I already had for the repo I made before creating those folders \*sigh\* idk.. I'll try manually adding it next time but I'll definately need to figure out why the way I did it didn't work.

### Day 2: April 27, 2022 


**Today's Progress**: Tried to fix the error in my JS tutorial project (Whac-a-Mole) I had lots of syntax errors like extra operators, misspelled words, and incorrectly named class or elements (?). While I got it to function way better and catch on to a few patterns, it's still v broken.

**Thoughts**: I felt like I had maybe 2 connections when I had problems with my code. I'm almost glad it didn't work the first time because then I had to hunt for what was wrong and that forced me to get familiar with the code, especially js.

### Day 3: April 28, 2022 


**Today's Progress**: Switched it up and practiced a different project from the Ania Kubrow JS games series. This one was rock paper scissors and it went better than WAM but still buggy.

**Thoughts**: Was able to recognize more errors quicker today.

### Day 4: April 29, 2022 


**Today's Progress**: I worked on my RPS project, finished it and now my buttons produce no output. Verys stuck. Have been searching for the error for 45 minutes!

**Thoughts**: This is good because it helps me focus on carefully coding and finding bugs.

### Day 5: April 30, 2022 


**Today's Progress**: I finally got my RPS project to work. 

**Thoughts**: During the project tutorial, the instructor made a mistake and because I was switching from coding and watching, I missed when she fixed it. That resulted in hours and hours of trying to compare and fix the code. The issue was putting spaces in an ***ID*** class value within the quotes when that is not allowed, it is allowed for class which is what I've used more of, so that's another reason why I didn't catch it. I might have to switch tutorials I didn't question my mistakes because I watched the instructor do them and yet, my code didn't work. I need to learn the rules better to catch that AND watch an instructor who verbalizes there mistakes and why they are bad. To be fair, Ania did say "oops, not there" when she put th espaces in the wrong place and promptly corrected it. I just missed it.

### Day 6: May 1, 2022 


**Today's Progress**: Happy May! Worked on a product landing page on FreeCodecamp.

**Thoughts**: This project was an unfinished one from 2021. I had 5/16 of the user stories done ( what freecodecamp required for the project to be fulfilled so see it as points) and was very overwhelmed with my practice by then. I felt like I didn't even know what I was looking at. Now, I was excited to revisit with new motvation and actually understnading way more of what I couldn't recognize before. I have 4/16 on the user stories because I was moving things around but I think I can finish this by tomorrow.

### Day 7: May 2, 2022 


**Today's Progress**: I worked on a product landing page on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I said I would finish this but they day just escaped me. I was so tired. But I did able to do work and explore and I had a lot of fun. I genuinely feel good about finishing this and will be really proud when I do. Divs were more approachable today and I was able to make things work with CSS with trial and error, but in a fruitful wasy where I learned.
